IllustrAIte is an interactive application that leverages OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images based on user prompts. The application was designed with the vision to make AI-generated image creation simple, interactive, and sharable.

Users can generate unique images simply by providing a description of what they'd like to see, share their creations with the community, and download their favorite pictures for personal use.

## Features

- Generate unique images through OpenAI's DALL-E API
- Share your images with the IllustrAIte community
- Download your favorite images
- Responsive and intuitive UI

## Tech Stack

This application is built using a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack:

- **React.js** for the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the backend
- **MongoDB** for the database
- **OpenAI's DALL-E API** for image generation

## Get Started
- Click the "Create" button at the top right of the page
- Enter your name, and a prompt for an image you want the AI to draw, or hit the Surprise Me button for an automatically generated prompt
- Hit the Generate button, and wait a couple of seconds till the image appears. Once it appears, you may hit the "Share" button to share with the community.
- You will be redirected to the hompage, where you will see your photo displayed, and you can no downlaod the image!

*Attempting to prompt the generator to generate explicit content is forbidden, and will result in a failure to produce the image
**It takes around 10 seconds to load in all the images from the server, so please be patient. The application works, just give it a little time. You dont have to wait for the images to load in to 
create your own image and share it.
